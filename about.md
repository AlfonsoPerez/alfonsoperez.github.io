Hi there!, my name is Alfonso, and I am a passionate software engineer wanna-be from Spain. I enjoy web app security, writing code, and non-ball related sports.

I will be updating this site with some things that bother me, or with things that I like!.

You can hit me up by DM on [twitter](http://twitter.com/alfonsopereze) or by e-mail on *alfon āt ratslap døt com*
