> This blog post is intented to be the first of a series. As currently I am writing [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) code on a daily basis, and it has opened me a brand-new world full of happiness and flowers, I am going to try to start giving back to the community, comments appreciated!.

A while ago, I was asking myself what could be a good side-project to have, and developing an app from scratch-to-deploy seemed fun, but if I was going to finally commit to it, it had to be to solve a problem that pissed me off enormously on a daily basis.

It also had to be written in Javascript, as it's a language I used to hate and as I have been digging further into it, it has become a language I trully love, it's the language of the web. After a calm research, I watched this video:

<div style="text-align: center"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVZ-P-ZI6W4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

And I immediatly fell in love with it.

So in this tutorial we will be building a starter social network using **React Native**, **Redux**, **Node**, **Express** and **MongoDB**.


## Starting up

> We are assuming here you are running OSX, [React Native for Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) is out already, so in the future I will update this post with relevant information

I think installing everything is well covered in the [Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content), so get back here when you are ready!...

Ok good?, So as the docs say, go ahead and introduce the following commands in a Terminal:

> npm install -g react-native-cli

> react-native init MyAwesomeApp

> cd MyAwesomeApp/

> open ios/MyAwesomeApp.xcodeproj

Hit the play button et Voila!
