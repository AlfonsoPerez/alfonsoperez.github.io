A couple of minutes ago, while I was waiting for some tests to run, I wanted to send a picture to my girlfriend about this awesome surf on an inland, to make her excited to go, and stumbled across a very stupid LFI Vulnerability in **Richtext Editor** Symphony extension latest version.

Yes, I am aware this may be really a pet project, unmaintained, and so on, but I have looked a bit and found some in the wild, so just throwing this for future quick reference of someone in the community.

## Details

- Vector of exploitation: Look at the picture.
- Vulnerable code: https://github.com/remie/richtext_redactor/blob/master/content/content.getfile.php#L98
- Why don't you submit a PR and stop whinning?: Because I am lazy, and have lots of things to do.
